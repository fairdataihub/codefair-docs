# Codefair App

The Codefair App is a GitHub application that installs on your repository and will monitor your repository for issues related to FAIR4RS principles. The GitHub application will provide you with a dashboard in the Issues section of your repository that will allow you to view and manage issues related to FAIR4RS principles. The GitHub application is developed with Probot to connect to the GitHub API and provide real-time updates on the issues in your repository.
