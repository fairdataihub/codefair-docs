# Upcoming Features

This section provides a list of upcoming features that will be added to Codefair in the future.

## Zenodo Archiving

The Zenodo Archiving feature allows you to archive your research software on Zenodo directly from the Codefair platform. Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. By archiving your research software on Zenodo, you can make it more discoverable and citable, enhancing its reusability and impact.

## Code Formatter

The Code Formatter is a feature that will allow Codefair to automatically format your code according to a set of predefined rules. This feature is useful for ensuring that your code is consistent and easy to read, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on.

## Security and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Review

Codefair will detect and flag any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in your codebase. This feature is designed to help you identify and remove sensitive information from your codebase before an official release.

## Pull Request Summary

The Pull Request Summary feature will provide a summary of the changes made in a pull request, analyzing the impact of the changes on the codebase. This feature will help you understand the scope of the changes and ensure that they align with your project goals.
