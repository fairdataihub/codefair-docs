# Zenodo Archiving

The Zenodo Archiving feature allows you to archive your research software on Zenodo directly from the Codefair platform. Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. By archiving your research software on Zenodo, you can make it more discoverable and citable, enhancing its reusability and impact.
