# LICENSE

The LICENSE issue is a common issue that can be found in repositories. The LICENSE issue is a problem that occurs when a repository does not have a LICENSE file. The LICENSE file is a file that contains the license information for the repository. The LICENSE file is important because it tells users how they can use the code in the repository. The LICENSE file is also important because it helps to protect the code in the repository. If a repository does not have a LICENSE file, it can be difficult for users to know how they can use the code in the repository. Once the LICENSE file is added to the repository, the LICENSE issue will be resolved. The LICENSE issue is an important issue to fix because it helps to make the code in the repository more usable and more accessible to users and is the first check to be done before checking other compliances. By fixing the LICENSE issue, you can help to make your repository more FAIR and more compliant with the FAIR4RS principles.
