# :handshake: CODE OF CONDUCT

A Code of Conduct outlines expected behaviors within a project's community, ensuring an inclusive, respectful and safe environment for all contributors. To help you build and maintain a positive community, Codefair checcks that your repository contains a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file. This file should be located at the root of your repository or in the `.github` or `docs` directory.

## :hammer: How to fix the Code of Conduct issue

If Codefair does not detect a code of conduct file it will flag a compliance issue on the dashboard. To resolve:

- Click on the **Add Code of Conduct** (or **Edit Code of Conduct** if a file already exists) button in the issue dashboard.
- The Code of Conduct editor UI will open, allowing you to select a code of conduct template from the dropdown list.
- Click **Save and push code of conduct to repository** to create a pull request.
- Review and merge the PR on GitHub (or click Save Draft to continue editing later).

::: info
This file is not mandatory, but highly recommended. You will still be able to make FAIR Archival releases without it.

## :memo: Code of Conduct Templates

Codefair offers a two templates provided by [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/). The Contributor Covenant is a widely used code of conduct template that provides guidelines for community behavior, while the Django Code of Conduct is suitable for large communities and events. You can choose either template based on your project's needs or customize your own by selecting the **Custom** option in the dropdown list.

## :fountain_pen: Code of Conduct editor UI

The editor UI lets you:

- Select a template from GitHub recommended templates or create a custom one.
- Preview how the file will appear on GitHub.
- Edit the contents directly.
- Save & push to create a pull request, or Save Draft to continue later.

::: warning
You must be signed in with your GitHub account to access the Code of Conduct editor. Codefair uses [GitHub OAuth](installation.md#key-oauth-sign-in-permissions) to sign into Codefair.
