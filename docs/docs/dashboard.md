# GitHub Issue Dashboard

The GitHub Issue Dashboard is a feature that allows you to view and manage issues your repository may have.
The dashboard is updated in real-time and provides a comprehensive overview of the issues in your repository.
A link to correct the issue is provided in the dashboard, making it easier to manage and resolve issues.
