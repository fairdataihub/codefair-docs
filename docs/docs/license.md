# LICENSE

In the [FAIR4RS Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x), principle R1.1 states "Software is given a clear and accessible license". This is critical because without a license, a software cannot be legally reused. To comply with this principle, the [FAIR-BioRS guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02463-x) instruct to include a LICENSE file with license terms.

## License Editor

The license editor is a user-friendly interface that allows you to edit the license of your research software. The license editor is designed to help you input and update the license of your research software in a simple and intuitive way.

The license editor provides you with a list of common licenses that you can choose from. Once selected the license content is displayed in the editor allowing you to review and update the license text. The license editor also provides you with a preview of the license text to help you understand how the license will be displayed in your repository.
