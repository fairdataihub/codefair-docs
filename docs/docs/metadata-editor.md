# Metadata Editor

The metadata editor is a user-friendly interface that allows you to edit the metadata of your research software. The metadata initially displayed is what Probot has gathered from your repository. The editor is designed to help you input and update the metadata of your research software in a simple and intuitive way.

The editor is broken into sections, each representing a different aspect of the metadata:

1. **General Information**: This section includes the title, description, and homepage of your repository.
2. **Discoverability**: This section includes the keywords and topics associated with your repository.
3. **License**: This section includes the license information for your repository.
4. **Software Requirements**: This section includes the software requirements for your repository.
5. **Current Version**: This section includes the version number and release date of your repository.
6. **Additional Information**: This section includes any additional information you would like to include in your metadata.
7. **Editorial Review**: This section includes the status of the metadata and any comments from the editorial review.
8. **Authors and Contributors**: This section includes the authors and contributors of your repository.
